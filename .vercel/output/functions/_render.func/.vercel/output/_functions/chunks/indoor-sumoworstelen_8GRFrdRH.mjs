At the game master's starting signal, the competition begins, and participants must push each other off the mat for half a point or make them fall for a full point. At the end, the winner of the match gets to make a victory jump on the loser. Everyone can participate multiple times.\n\nA novelty is the sumo twin fighting, a very fun variant of the well-known sumo wrestling, where good teamwork with your sumo partner is required.\nA round of sumo wrestling not only challenges the participants' fitness but also the spectators' laugh muscles - so keep your camera ready!\n";
