    "description": "<p>My father had his own event agency. After my training as a top sports shooter, I started organizing shooting initiatives.</p><p>It frustrates me that many team building companies listen too little to customer needs and always organize the same activities, often in an amateurish way.</p><p>That's why I started building an extensive program of unique activities 15 years ago. Personal contact with the customer was paramount.</p><p>It is my conviction that companies should have a pleasant day without worries, so their employees emerge as a strengthened team from the experience.</p>"
