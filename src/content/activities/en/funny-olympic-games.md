Each team represents a country and challenges each other in playful "Olympic disciplines."

The competition includes classic sports such as relay race, sumo wrestling, and tug of war (an Olympic sport until 1920), but skills like concentration, teamwork, and insight are also put to the test, as these are just as crucial for a top athlete.

Which team will raise their flag to glorious heights? Of course, we cherish the Olympic spirit at all times. The various disciplines can be adapted to the location and your specific wishes, making this activity a perfect combination of sporting challenges and team building.
