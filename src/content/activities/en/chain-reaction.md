This team building activity is entirely focused on collaboration and creativity. Together, we will work to create an impressive Goldberg machine. The chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and you'll have an abundance of materials at your disposal. Think marble runs, domino tiles, huge LEGO blocks, and electric devices.

The challenge is to design and build the wildest, but most importantly, functional design. After a thorough check, we'll start the chain reaction at the beginning, and hopefully, it will end without assistance in a spectacular finale. For the extra motivated teams, there are optional trials available through which additional materials can be earned to make your machine even more impressive. It's all about teamwork, innovation, and achieving a spectacular end result together.
