Get ready for a team building experience that takes you to the future of innovation. This unique experience includes a range of new and groundbreaking activities, specially designed for dynamic team building.

Discover the impact of Virtual Reality (VR) on the brain: work together to defuse a bomb, jump from an 80-story building, swing a lightsaber, and more.
Shoot with innovative laser clay pigeon rifles, environmentally friendly and accessible to everyone.
Experience lightsaber fencing, inspired by Star Wars, the latest sensation in official fencing disciplines.

Learn to fly drones: we provide very user-friendly drones, while the team quickly completes a course and takes photos or fly along with the drone via FPV goggles. A trust test follows at the end.

Test your shooting skills with infrared biathlon rifles and sports pistols from Finland. Coached by team members using a console, discover who shoots best.

Defuse a physical bomb or save a nuclear power plant with our innovative escape boxes.
Shoot with the newest and most environmentally friendly form of paintball: GelBlaster
