The location is steeped in Swedish atmosphere, decorated with Swedish flags, and teams challenge each other with Scandinavian activities. Think biathlon shooting (INFRARÃ–D SKIDSKYTTE), axe throwing (KASTA YXA), playing kubb, Swedish puzzles, assembling IKEA cabinets, and more.

The teams will discover that success depends on combining their strengths. And who knows, maybe the catering will include delicious Swedish meatballs to fully immerse participants in Swedish culture.
