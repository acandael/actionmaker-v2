Indoor laser shooting is an exciting team activity that focuses on strategy, communication, and teamwork. In a specially designed indoor arena, teams compete against each other in various challenging game modes.

Participants are equipped with professional laser pistols and sensors and must then complete various missions and tasks as a team. The activity is completely safe and suitable for all age groups and fitness levels.

The various game modes provide variety and excitement, from classic team deathmatch to objective-based missions. After each round, scores and statistics are discussed, which adds a competitive element and provides the opportunity to adjust tactics.
