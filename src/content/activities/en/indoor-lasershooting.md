Would you like to show off your shooting skills in a spectacular but completely safe setting? Indoor laser clay pigeon shooting offers excitement and fun for everyone, even those who are less adventurous. Perfect for indoor use or when the distance is too short for regular laser clay pigeon shooting.

## How does it work?

Shoot at 5 set-up targets with original Winchester rifles.
Up to five participants shoot simultaneously. The challenge? Who will hit the target first?
All this happens with a special infrared system, making it completely safe with no damage to the location.

## What makes it so fun

Completely safe: Since shooting is done with infrared, there is no danger. Plus, the rifles have no recoil.
Environmentally friendly: No waste from broken clay pigeons or lead pollution.
Suitable for everyone: Even if you've never shot before, this is a great activity for young and old alike.
