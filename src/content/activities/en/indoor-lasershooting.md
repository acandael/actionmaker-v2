Would you like to show off your shooting skills in a spectacular but completely safe setting? Indoor laser clay pigeon shooting offers excitement and fun for everyone, even those who are less adventurous. Perfect for indoor use or when the distance is too short for regular laser clay pigeon shooting.

## How does it work?

Shoot with original Winchester rifles at 5 set up targets.
Up to five participants shoot simultaneously. The challenge? Who hits the target first?
All of this happens with a special infrared system, making it completely safe and causing no damage to the location.

## What makes it so fun

Completely safe: Since shooting is done with infrared, there is no danger. Plus, the rifles have no recoil.
Environmentally friendly: No waste from broken clay pigeons or lead pollution.
Suitable for everyone: Even if you've never shot before, this is a great activity for young and old alike.
