Within the group, there are several members who are not who they appear to be, and it's up to you to discover who they really are. At various moments, we will gather at the oval table to discuss and exchange opinions. After these intense conversations, a voting round follows.

By successfully completing assignments, participants can protect themselves or earn an extra vote. The game challenges participants to play tactically. Who employs the most well-thought-out strategy? Who possesses the greatest power of persuasion?
