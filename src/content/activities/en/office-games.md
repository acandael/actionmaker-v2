This team building sheds light on the diverse talents within your office. Which team constructs the best paper airplane, who succeeds best in writing as many recognizable words together (1 pencil, 10 strings to control it), and who proves to be the fastest in the office chair race?

Physical strength, communication skills, creativity, and teamwork are all addressed. We have put together a varied program with challenging activities that call upon different aspects of your talents.
