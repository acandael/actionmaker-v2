## Murder Dinner 1

In this murder game, everyone sits down at the table in memory of the beloved deceased. But soon it becomes clear that the murderer is in your company...
The murder dinner is a nerve-wracking murder game where you must uncover the identity of a ruthless killer. This is done through clues that you earn by completing group tasks. But beware: The murderer won't simply let you work undisturbed. They will do everything to prevent you from successfully completing the tasks... The best detective who manages to prevent further misfortune receives a suitable reward.
