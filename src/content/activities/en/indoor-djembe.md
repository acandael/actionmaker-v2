This team building is ideal for strengthening team spirit. Making music together as a team creates a unique experience and provides a positive group feeling. It allows colleagues to focus on playing together and offers them a different way of communicating with each other. The group dynamics are positively influenced as a result. No prior knowledge is required. This can be combined with eco-percussion, for example.
