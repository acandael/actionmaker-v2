The introduction is conducted with the recurve two-handed bow.

First, participants shoot some practice arrows. The animator tries to improve the shooters' stance. It's certainly not easy, but one can improve quickly. After a few arrows, it will become apparent that you feel more and more familiar with the stance and shooting.

This is followed by a competition between the participants. Various game formats can also be used.
