Although often seen as a men's sport, it is also very accessible for women.
Axe throwing is surprisingly easy, most people hit the target within their first five to ten throws. The challenge lies in throwing consistently well. The sport requires more relaxation and rhythm than raw strength.

Feel like a strong Viking for once.
We conclude with a competition to see who has learned the most.
