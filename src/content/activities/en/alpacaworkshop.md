Thanks to their unique character, alpacas are excellent for exploring different ways to approach a situation as a team.
Through small tasks, you learn more about trust, communication, and leadership in your team. You decide which topic you want to address in your team: communication, collaboration and conflict management, or just fun. These sensitive animals give direct feedback to humans and their behavior. They sense whether something is harmonious; your actual reaction with your true feeling.

Does your alpaca stop, pull against you, not want to go along? All these are indications that something in your communication with them isn't right. We give you tips and discuss how you can continue with your alpaca. This is not an ordinary 'walk', this is an effective agility exercise with your animal.
